Oh, I cannot explain
Every time it's the same
Oh, I feel that it's real
Take my heart
I've been lonely too long
Oh, I can't be so strong
Take a chance for romance
Take my heart
I need you so
There's no time
I'll ever go

Cheri Cheri Lady
Goin' through emotion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart
Cheri Cheri Lady
Livin' in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part
